# Drinks UI
The frontend for the automated drink machine. Written in Vue with Typescript.

## History
This project inherited from the original angular-drinks repo built on AngularJS.

That project wasn't updated for a long time and transferring anything already completed into Vue made it a bit easier to maintain.

## Technologies
- VueJS 2.0
- Vue CLI 3.0
- Typescript 2.8
